# Basic usage

With Markk you write in Markdown files. Whenever you add a code block that will be added to the final build.

```html
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <h1>Markk</h1>
    <p>A documentation driven framework</p>
  </body>

```
This allows you to always have your documentation live with your code in an ... interesting way.


```html
  <style>
  h1 {
    color: red;
  } 
  </style>
```

## JavaScript!

You can even add JavaScript.

```html
  <script>
    alert('Wow!');
  </script>
```

# Markk

A documentation driven web framework

## This is an experiment

I had this stupid idea which is now being realized into a stupid project.

With Markk you write your documentation first and it will then take all code examples and create a web site from them.

See the `/src` folder for examples.

## Why is it named Markk?

It is named after American Stenographic Court Reporter Mark Kislingbury who is the fastest court reporter.

# Markk

A documentation driven web framework

## This is an experiment

I had this stupid idea which is now being realized into a stupid project.

With Markk you write your documentation first in markdown and it will then take all code examples and create a web site or a JS library from them.

Markk it self is written in Markk! See `src/index.md` for the *actual* source code!

See the `/test/mocks` folder for more examples.

## Installing

`npm install -g markk`

### Usage

`markk --build` builds your project and outputs it to a `build` folder. It assumes you have your markdown files in a folder named `src`.

## Why is it named Markk?

It is named after American Stenographic Court Reporter Mark Kislingbury who is the fastest court reporter.
